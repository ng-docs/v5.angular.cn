It implements core and optional functionality as a set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps.</p>\n<p>The basic building blocks of an Angular application are <em>NgModules</em>, which provide a compilation context for <em>components</em>. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is defined by a set of NgModules. An app always has at least a <em>root module</em> that enables bootstrapping, and typically has many more <em>feature modules</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Components define <em>views</em>, which are sets of screen elements that Angular can choose among and modify according to your program logic and data. Every app has at least a root component.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Components use <em>services</em>, which provide specific functionality not directly related to views. Service providers can be <em>injected</em> into components as <em>dependencies</em>, making your code modular, reusable, and efficient.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both components and services are simply classes, with <em>decorators</em> that mark their type and provide metadata that tells Angular how to use them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The metadata for a component class associates it with a <em>template</em> that defines a view. A template combines ordinary HTML with Angular <em>directives</em> and <em>binding markup</em> that allow Angular to modify the HTML before rendering it for display.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The metadata for a service class provides the information Angular needs to make it available to components through <em>Dependency Injection (DI)</em>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An app's components typically define many views, arranged hierarchically. Angular provides the <code><a href=\"api/router/Router\" class=\"code-anchor\">Router</a></code> service to help you define navigation paths among views. The router provides sophisticated in-browser navigational capabilities.</p>\n<h2 id=\"modules\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/architecture#modules\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Modules</h2>\n<p>Angular defines the <code><a href=\"api/core/NgModule\" class=\"code-anchor\">NgModule</a></code>, which differs from and complements the JavaScript (ES2015) module. An NgModule declares a compilation context for a set of components that is dedicated to an application domain, a workflow, or a closely related set of capabilities. An NgModule can associate its components with related code, such as services, to form functional units.</p>\n<p>Every Angular app has a <em>root module</em>, conventionally named <code>AppModule</code>, which provides the bootstrap mechanism that launches the application. An app typically contains many functional modules.</p>\n<p>Like JavaScript modules, NgModules can import functionality from other NgModules, and allow their own functionality to be exported and used by other NgModules. For example, to use the router service in your app, you import the <code><a href=\"api/router/Router\" class=\"code-anchor\">Router</a></code> NgModule.</p>\n<p>Organizing your code into distinct functional modules helps in managing development of complex applications, and in designing for reusability. In addition, this technique lets you take advantage of <em>lazy-loading</em>—that is, loading modules on demand—in order to minimize the amount of code that needs to be loaded at startup.</p>\n<div class=\"l-sub-section\">\n<p>  For a more detailed discussion, see <a href=\"guide/architecture-modules\">Introduction to modules</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"components\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/architecture#components\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Components</h2>\n<p>Every Angular application has at least one component, the <em>root component</em> that connects a component hierarchy with the page DOM. Each component defines a class that contains application data and logic, and is associated with an HTML <em>template</em> that defines a view to be displayed in a target environment.</p>\n<p>The <code>@<a href=\"api/core/Component\" class=\"code-anchor\">Component</a></code> decorator identifies the class immediately below it as a component, and provides the template and related component-specific metadata.</p>\n<div class=\"l-sub-section\">\n<p>   Decorators are functions that modify JavaScript classes. Angular defines a number of such decorators that attach specific kinds of metadata to classes, so that it knows what those classes mean and how they should work.</p>\n<p>   <a href=\"https://medium.com/google-developers/exploring-es7-decorators-76ecb65fb841#.x5c2ndtx0\">Learn more about decorators on the web.</a></p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"templates-directives-and-data-binding\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/architecture#templates-directives-and-data-binding\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Templates, directives, and data binding</h3>\n<p>A template combines HTML with Angular markup that can modify the HTML elements before they are displayed.\nTemplate <em>directives</em> provide program logic, and <em>binding markup</em> connects your application data and the document object model (DOM).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Event binding</em> lets your app respond to user input in the target environment by updating your application data.</li>\n<li><em>Property binding</em> lets you interpolate values that are computed from your application data into the HTML.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Before a view is displayed, Angular evaluates the directives and resolves the binding syntax in the template to modify the HTML elements and the DOM, according to your program data and logic. Angular supports <em>two-way data binding</em>, meaning that changes in the DOM, such as user choices, can also be reflected back into your program data.</p>\n<p>Your templates can also use <em>pipes</em> to improve the user experience by transforming values for display. Use pipes to display, for example, dates and currency values in a way appropriate to the user's locale. Angular provides predefined pipes for common transformations, and you can also define your own.</p>\n<div class=\"l-sub-section\">\n<p>  For a more detailed discussion of these concepts, see <a href=\"guide/architecture-components\">Introduction to components</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<a id=\"dependency-injection\"></a>\n<h2 id=\"services-and-dependency-injection\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/architecture#services-and-dependency-injection\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Services and dependency injection</h2>\n<p>For data or logic that is not associated with a specific view, and that you want to share across components, you create a <em>service</em> class. A service class definition is immediately preceded by the <code>@<a href=\"api/core/Injectable\" class=\"code-anchor\">Injectable</a></code> decorator. The decorator provides the metadata that allows your service to be <em>injected</em> into client components as a dependency.</p>\n<p> <em>Dependency injection</em> (or DI) lets you keep your component classes lean and efficient. They don't fetch data from the server, validate user input, or log directly to the console; they delegate such tasks to services.</p>\n<div class=\"l-sub-section\">\n<p>  For a more detailed discusssion, see <a href=\"guide/architecture-services\">Introduction to services and DI</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"routing\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/architecture#routing\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Routing</h3>\n<p>The Angular <code><a href=\"api/router/Router\" class=\"code-anchor\">Router</a></code> NgModule provides a service that lets you define a navigation path among the different application states and view hierarchies in your app. It is modeled on the familiar browser navigation conventions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enter a URL in the address bar and the browser navigates to a corresponding page.</li>\n<li>Click links on the page and the browser navigates to a new page.</li>\n<li>Click the browser's back and forward buttons and the browser navigates backward and forward through the history of pages you've seen.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The router maps URL-like paths to views instead of pages. When a user performs an action, such as clicking a link, that would load a new page in the browser, the router intercepts the browser's behavior, and shows or hides view hierarchies.</p>\n<p>If the router determines that the current application state requires particular functionality, and the module that defines it has not been loaded, the router can <em>lazy-load</em> the module on demand.</p>\n<p>The router interprets a link URL according to your app's view navigation rules and data state. You can navigate to new views when the user clicks a button, selects from a drop box, or in response to some other stimulus from any source. The Router logs activity in the browser's history journal, so the back and forward buttons work as well.</p>\n<p>To define navigation rules, you associate <em>navigation paths</em> with your components. A path uses a URL-like syntax that integrates your program data, in much the same way that template syntax integrates your views with your program data. You can then apply program logic to choose which views to show or to hide, in response to user input and your own access rules.</p>\n <div class=\"l-sub-section\">\n<p>   For a more detailed discussion, see <a href=\"guide/router\">Routing and navigation</a>.</p>\n </div>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"whats-next\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/architecture#whats-next\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>What's next</h2>\n<p>You've learned the basics about the main building blocks of an Angular application.
