A service is typically a class with a narrow, well-defined purpose. It should do something specific and do it well.\n<br class=\"clear\"></p>\n<p>Angular distinguishes components from services in order to increase modularity and reusability.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>By separating a component's view-related functionality from other kinds of processing, you can make your component classes lean and efficient. Ideally, a component's job is to enable the user experience and nothing more.  It should present properties and methods for data binding, in order to mediate between the view (rendered by the template) and the application logic (which often includes some notion of a <em>model</em>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A component should not need to define things like how to fetch data from the server, validate user input, or log directly to the console. Instead, it can delegate such tasks to services. By defining that kind of processing task in an injectable service class, you make it available to any component. You can also make your app more adaptable by injecting different providers of the same kind of service, as appropriate in different circumstances.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Angular doesn't <em>enforce</em> these principles. Angular does help you <em>follow</em> these principles by making it easy to factor your\napplication logic into services and make those services available to components through <em>dependency injection</em>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"service-examples\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/architecture-services#service-examples\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Service examples</h2>\n<p>Here's an example of a service class that logs to the browser console:</p>\n<code-example path=\"architecture/src/app/logger.service.ts\" linenums=\"false\" title=\"src/app/logger.service.ts (class)\" region=\"class\">\nexport class Logger {\n  log(msg: any)   { console.log(msg); }\n  error(msg: any) { console.error(msg); }\n  warn(msg: any)  { console.warn(msg); }\n}\n\n\n</code-example>\n<p>Services can depend on other services. For example, here's a <code>HeroService</code> that depends on the <code>Logger</code> service, and also uses <code>BackendService</code> to get heroes. That service in turn might depend on the <code><a href=\"api/common/http/HttpClient\" class=\"code-anchor\">HttpClient</a></code> service to fetch heroes asynchronously from a server.</p>\n<code-example path=\"architecture/src/app/hero.service.ts\" linenums=\"false\" title=\"src/app/hero.service.ts (class)\" region=\"class\">\nexport class HeroService {\n  private heroes: Hero[] = [];\n\n  constructor(\n    private backend: BackendService,\n    private logger: Logger) { }\n\n  getHeroes() {\n    this.backend.getAll(Hero).then( (heroes: Hero[]) => {\n      this.logger.log(`Fetched ${heroes.length} heroes.`);\n      this.heroes.push(...heroes); // fill cache\n    });\n    return this.heroes;\n  }\n}\n\n\n</code-example>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"dependency-injection\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/architecture-services#dependency-injection\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Dependency injection</h2>\n<img src=\"generated/images/guide/architecture/dependency-injection.png\" alt=\"Service\" class=\"left\" width=\"200\" height=\"90\">\n<p>Components consume services; that is, you can <em>inject</em> a service into a component, giving the component access to that service class. </p>\n<p>To define a class as a service in Angular, use the <code>@<a href=\"api/core/Injectable\" class=\"code-anchor\">Injectable</a></code> decorator to provide the metadata that allows Angular to inject it into a component as a <em>dependency</em>.  </p>\n<p>Similarly, use the <code>@<a href=\"api/core/Injectable\" class=\"code-anchor\">Injectable</a></code> decorator to indicate that a component or other class (such as another service, a pipe, or an NgModule) <em>has</em> a dependency. A dependency doesn't have to be a serviceâ€”it could be a function, for example, or a value. </p>\n<p><em>Dependency injection</em> (often called DI) is wired into the Angular framework and used everywhere to provide new components with the services or other things they need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The <em>injector</em> is the main mechanism. You don't have to create an Angular injector. Angular creates an application-wide injector for you during the bootstrap process.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The injector maintains a <em>container</em> of dependency instances that it has already created, and reuses them if possible.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A <em>provider</em> is a recipe for creating a dependency. For a service, this is typically the service class itself. For any dependency you need in your app, you must register a provider with the app's injector, so that the injector can use it to create new instances.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When Angular creates a new instance of a component class, it determines which services or other dependencies that component needs by looking at the types of its constructor parameters. For example, the constructor of <code>HeroListComponent</code> needs a <code>HeroService</code>:</p>\n<code-example path=\"architecture/src/app/hero-list.component.ts\" linenums=\"false\" title=\"src/app/hero-list.component.ts (constructor)\" region=\"ctor\">\nconstructor(private service: HeroService) { }\n\n</code-example>\n<p>When Angular discovers that a component depends on a service, it first checks if the injector already has any existing instances of that service. If a requested service instance does not yet exist, the injector makes one using the registered provider, and adds it to the injector before returning the service to Angular.</p>\n<p>When all requested services have been resolved and returned, Angular can call the component's constructor with those services as arguments.</p>\n<p>The process of <code>HeroService</code> injection looks something like this:</p>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"generated/images/guide/architecture/injector-injects.png\" alt=\"Service\" class=\"left\" width=\"479\" height=\"218\">\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"providing-services\"><a title=\"Link to this heading\" class=\"header-link\" aria-hidden=\"true\" href=\"guide/architecture-services#providing-services\"><i class=\"material-icons\">link</i></a>Providing services</h3>\n<p>You must register at least one <em>provider</em> of any service you are going to use. You can register providers in modules or in components.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you add providers to the <a href=\"guide/architecture-modules\">root module</a>, the same instance of a service is available to all components in your app.</li>\n</ul>\n<code-example path=\"architecture/src/app/app.module.ts\" linenums=\"false\" title=\"src/app/app.module.ts (module providers)\" region=\"providers\">\nproviders: [\n  BackendService,\n  HeroService,\n  Logger\n],\n\n</code-example>\n<ul>\n<li>When you register a provider at the component level, you get a new instance of the\nservice with each new instance of that component. At the component level, register a service provider in the <code>providers</code> property of the <code>@<a href=\"api/core/Component\" class=\"code-anchor\">Component</a></code> metadata:</li>\n</ul>\n<code-example path=\"architecture/src/app/hero-list.component.ts\" linenums=\"false\" title=\"src/app/hero-list.component.ts (component providers)\" region=\"providers\">\n@<a href=\"api/core/Component\" class=\"code-anchor\">Component</a>({\n  selector:    'app-hero-list',\n  templateUrl: './hero-list.component.html',\n  providers:  [ HeroService ]\n})\n\n</code-example>\n<p>For more detailed information, see the <a href=\"guide/dependency-injection\">Dependency Injection</a> section.</p>\n<hr>\n\n</div>\n<!-- links to this doc:\n - guide/architecture\n - guide/architecture-modules\n-->\n<!-- links from this doc:\n - api/common/http/HttpClient\n - api/core/Component\n - api/core/Injectable\n - guide/architecture-modules\n - guide/architecture-services#dependency-injection\n - guide/architecture-services#introduction-to-services-and-dependency-injection\n - guide/architecture-services#providing-services\n - guide/architecture-services#service-examples\n - guide/dependency-injection\n-->"
